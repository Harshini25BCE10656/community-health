Project Title
“Community Health Advisor”

Overview of the Project
This is a simple Python-based command-line application designed to provide users with recommended community health measures and precautions for various diseases such as COVID-19, Influenza, Cholera, and Heat Stroke. By entering a disease name, users receive instant, easy-to-understand advice on preventive actions to protect themselves and others. The project aims to raise awareness of common health measures and promote public safety.

Features
•	Displays a list of supported health conditions.
•	Accepts user input for disease or health condition names.
•	Provides detailed precautions tailored to the entered condition.
•	Delivers general hygiene advice if the condition is not recognized.
•	Allows continuous querying until the user decides to exit.
•	Case-insensitive user input handling.
•	Input validation to prevent blank entries.

Technologies/Tools Used
•	Python (3.x recommended)
•	Any Python IDE or text editor (such as VS Code)
•	Command-line interface for interaction

Steps to Install & Run the Project
1.	Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2.	Download or copy the project source code file (e.g., community_health_advisor.py).
3.	Open a terminal or command prompt.
4.	Navigate to the directory containing the source code file.
5.	Run the program with the command:
                  python community_health_advisor.py
6.	Follow on-screen prompts to enter disease names or type exit to quit.

Instructions for Testing
•	Test by entering supported conditions, e.g., covid-19, influenza, cholera, and heat stroke.
•	Test case insensitivity by mixing uppercase/lowercase letters.
•	Enter exit to verify program termination.
•	Test invalid inputs such as empty strings or unknown diseases (e.g., malaria) to check that the program responds with general advice and prompts correctly.
