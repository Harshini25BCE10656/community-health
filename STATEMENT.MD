Problem Statement
Many people often lack immediate access to reliable, easy-to-understand health guidelines for common diseases such as COVID-19, influenza, cholera, and heat stroke. This project provides a simple command-line tool that offers community health measures and precautions for such conditions instantly upon user request.

Scope of the Project
The project aims to deliver a lightweight, easy-to-use Python program that enables users to query health precautions for selected diseases. It focuses on limited but important conditions and can be expanded in the future. The program handles user input, displays relevant safety measures, and offers generic advice when an unknown condition is entered.

Target Users
•	General public seeking quick health precaution information
•	Community health workers and educators
•	Students and beginners learning programming with practical health-related applications

High-Level Features
•	Displays a list of supported health conditions
•	Accepts user input for disease or health condition name
•	Provides a list of recommended community health measures related to the input
•	Handles unknown inputs gracefully with general advice
•	Allows the user to query repeatedly until they choose to exit
